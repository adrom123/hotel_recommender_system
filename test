Great place to stay.Really affordable with friendly staff.Amazing food. Chinese breakfast with a glitter of chinese spice made my day. Lunch was also superb with dimsums and choupsey. the Staff was properly dressed and well behaved.If you opt for breakfast as a extra it's a little expensive compared with food everywhere else at 30Y , but is an all you can eat, we enjoyed the museli. 

good place. good food. good rooms.!!!!! Food was delicious. The Spicy indian food was excuisite and the desert,something somecial in india was also sweet. Rooms were very spacious along with the bathroom. Bathroom had a very big bathtub with the essence of natural beauty. i will give this hotel a rating of 5 on 5 with specially extra clean bathroom and luxurious room. along with this the ndian cuisine was very good. The chef himself asked us the kind of spices we wanted.

 Exceptionally Good	We booked just the one night here due to time constraints.The service was excellent - polite, efficient and informed.We were surprised by quite how good the en-suite twin room was.The location is excellent -... close by the Forbidden City and a leisurely 15-minute stroll down to Tian'anmen Square. The nearest metro (Dengshikou, I think it was) is about 10 minutes walk away (once you realise that it's quicker walking down the alleys) and the nearest bus stop is about two minutes away.The reception staff was extra helpful and polite.Room was very well maintained and even the food is good

I stayed here over Christmas 2006 and found the hotel to be a disaster. Small rooms. Boring surroundings!!!! Even the staff was lazy. Room service didnt turn up on time. Towels were pretty bad. Bathroom was not clean,not expected this from a 3 star hotel in dubai. no internet. wont ask anyone to live here.

Decent hotel with spacious lobby. free wifi free internet. Very punctual room service. Food good. the best was the location. Just in front of burj al khalifa we could get the view of the fog clouding the top of the hotel. They even provided us free sightseeing for dubai and rental service. The Al Khaleeg Hotel is in the old town of Deira and is ten minutes walk from the gold/spice souks and the markets.""""""On arrival at 5.20am in the morning from Singapore, the night porter brought me a kettle to make some tea and also some cakes. No charge was made for this and it was most welcome. Great value for money...

Avoid try somewhere else. i paid 2000 bucks for this 4 star hotel which is like quite expensive and what i got was a 2 star experience. Although the location was good but the ameneties sucked. The lobby had very less seating space and we had wait for like one hour at the reception to get a seat at the lobby. WIFI was present but internet didnt work. The only decent thing was the location and the staff.Even the cab service they provided was not on time.

WOW!! simply WOW.. economical and best service. Awesome burger. :).......trendy elevators. big rooms. nice staff. Their own site seeing package was also a bonus. They made us see the whole city at a reasonable amount. The swimming pool was also spacious and the spa was chocolaty. 

Best pool in the world! the swimming pool was like as big as the hotel itself with wonderful tousrist and surroundings. 28 story hotel had like 7 elavators from where you could see the whole city. staff was normal and so was the complimentry breakfast.Room were decent. Although costly the hotel had very beautiful ambiance. The Wi-Fi access/speed is great, the television programming needs improvement since there are very few channels available. the spa centre was present near to the pool and was quite decent

Sound sleeper?While the hotel had great prices (cheaper booking online in advance) and the rooms were adequate it's quite noisy. Not only are other guests yelling at each other in the thin walled hallways (they do have shhhh please signs posted to no avail), but one morning the employees were even on their walkie-talkies at 5:30am with the thing buzzing back and forth. The elavators dont work in the night and the pool was dirty. on our complaining to clear the pool no actions were taken. Even the Spa was like aburden instead of relaxation.
