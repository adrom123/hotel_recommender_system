content:Good hotel. When we arrived at the Hotel, we breezed through check-in and were given the same price quoted on SinoHotel.com so there were no $$ issues. We stayed in a 3-bedroom apartment-style space (the &quotlarge&quot version offered on the website), with 2 full bathrooms

content:Good hotel. Hotel excellent	We stayed at the Al Bustana 7 years ago and were very impressed so we stayed there again this month. It has if anything got better and in the meantime we have stayed at hotels across the world and the Al Bustan is up there with the best. One minor point it is close to airport so no problems getting to and from the airport which is very useful bearing in mind Dubai traffic jams but it does mean it takes time to get into town if you intend to spend a lot of time there. Hotel provides a taxi service charged at normal rates., nice vehicles good drivers.
