content:Nice trendy hotel location not too bad.	I stayed in this hotel for one night. As this is a fairly new place some of the taxi drivers did not know where it was and/or did not want to drive there. Once I have eventually arrived at the hotel, I was very pleasantly surprised with the decor of the lobby/ground floor area. It was very stylish and modern. I found the reception's staff geeting me with 'Aloha' a bit out of place, but I guess they are briefed to say that to keep up the coroporate image.As I have a Starwood Preferred Guest member, I was given a small gift upon-check in. It was only a couple of fridge magnets in a gift box, but nevertheless a nice gesture.My room was nice and roomy, there are tea and coffee facilities in each room and you get two complimentary bottles of water plus some toiletries by 'bliss'.The location is not great. It is at the last metro stop and you then need to take a taxi, but if you are not planning on going to see the historic sites in Beijing, then you will be ok.I chose to have some breakfast in the hotel, which was really tasty and there was a good selection of dishes. There are a couple of computers to use in the communal area, as well as a pool table. There is also a small swimming pool and a gym area.I would definitely stay in this hotel again, but only if I did not plan to travel to central Beijing, as it can take a long time. The location is ok if you plan to do a lot of shopping, as there is a big shopping centre just few minutes away from the hotel and there are plenty of eating options around, including restaurants that serve a dog meat!

content:clean rooms good location poor service	check-in my friends are i arrived from different countries @ different times and were greeted in the same lousy way. the bellboy did not help with luggage. the doorman did not open door. and the receptionist took more than 5 minutes to greet us with no smile despite having no other guest in the lobby. in sum, not pleasant.room we had the 2 bedroom suite. very spacious and comfy with all basic amenities. bathroom was spacious with separate bathtub and shower area equipped with l'occitaine toiletries. but they do not provide us with new ones even tho we have finished them. we had to ask the receptionist/concierge TWICE before getting more toiletries to shower. the washing machine is brilliant, but the 4 of us were not clever enough to work out how to wash and dry the 4 days we were there. Ended up doing the laundry by hand. location central and within walking distance to the train station and food places. slight difficulty getting a taxi tho. 7eleven is just round the corner. and there's a starbucks on the ground floor.breakfast small but good spread with standard egg station, fruits, breads and some local congee and hot food.massage/spa we had massage and Chinese pedicure there. pedicurist is a man who told us how maggie cheung went there for a massage a while ago. quality of massage and pedicure was average.

content:A fantastic hotel	My boyfriend and I stayed in the Autumn Garden hotel at the end of our trans-siberian railway trip from Moscow and staying there was one of the highlights of an amazing holiday. Staying in the hutong was so much better than an international style hotel, we really felt that we experienced a 'real' bit of Beijing. We loved the choice of english or chinese breakfasts, the room was gorgeous and having free internet was incredibly useful. The location was wonderful too, only 10 minutes walk to Tiananmen square.nice place to stayThe staff are extremely helpful and friendly, enabling you to find your bearings by providing a trishaw facility to the main road from the hotel. The location of the hotel is a 5 minute walk from Qianmen subway and the furnishings of the hotel rich in tradition. You may not get the western breakfasts you do in more modern hotels but it gives you an opportunity to live like the locals.

name:Bamboo Garden Hotel
location:Beijing,China
date:Oct 11 2009
content:A hidden gem	We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights at the start of our holiday and again for 3 nights before returning to the UK. We chose this hotel as a change from the main chain hotels in Beijing which we have stayed in on previous visits.This is a lovely hotel within reasonable walking distance, through the hutongs, to the lakes Houhai &amp Quanhai. The metro line is a short walk from the hotel and taxis are cheap and plentiful on the main road near to the hotel.Despite being in a very busy part of Beijing the hotel is exceptionally quite and peaceful. We had a suite on the ground floor (room 407). The bed was giantic but, as with most Chinese beds, quite hard. The pillows were the best pillows I have ever slept on and the linen was spotlessly clean as were the rooms.The lounge room furntiure was classical Chinese carved wood, gorgeous to look at but not the most comfortable to sit on. We had a computer in the room with free internet acess which was a bonus. The rooms and the bathroom were spotless. Due to the position of our room there was not a lot of natural light.Breakfast was included in our deal and was ok. The main problem was that some of the food was not hot, in fact somtimes not even warm. That said there was a very good variety and the staff were helpful and friendly.All the staff were very helpful and we would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn't wish to stay in a tall, concrete block where every room is the same.

content:Great hotel for large groups! (and individuals...)	I traveled to Beijing in June 2006 with 6 friends and we needed an inexpensive hotel that would hold our large group. The Century Towers Beijing hotel was PERFECT. We made a reservation through www.sinohotel.com, which I was nervous about at first, not being familiar with them. The customer service reps were fantastic, responding to all my spastic e-mails quickly and with great care. When we arrived at the Hotel, we breezed through check-in and were given the same price quoted on SinoHotel.com so there were no $$ issues. We stayed in a 3-bedroom apartment-style space (the &quotlarge&quot version offered on the website), with 2 full bathrooms (American Standard fixtures) a full kitchen, and a dining room. It even included a washer/dryer in the unit, though we didn't have any need to use it. The apartment was very clean, air-conditioned, and spacious, even with the 7 of us, we had plenty of room to relax! The hotel is across the street from a HUGE supermarket, so we ended up cooking most breakfasts in the room, saving even more money! We kept lots of cold bottled water in the fridge to take with us on our adventures in the hot, dry summer weather of Beijing. The room included a large flat-screen TV in the living room with cable, and a few English-language channels like the BBC (and the Simpsons!)Other really nice aspects of the hotel include a work-out room in the basement with treadmills, stationary bikes, a rowing machine, ballet bar, free weights, and weight machines. The hotel restaurant is very small but serves good food. The wait staff (and most of China) speak very little English, so learn basic Chinese phrases and expec to smile and point a lot ) We are traveling to Shanghai in the Summer of 2007 and if Century Towers has a location there, we would absolutely stay again! I think the price is much cheaper at this hotel because it's a Chinese hotel, not a foreign chain. We paid about $85 USD/night for this large 3 bedroom apartment-style room. Between the 7 of us, the price was certainly right!

content:Worst Hotel I have ever seen!	I travel the nation almost every weekend of the school year representing my school's track and field team. Never in any of my endeavors have I encountered such a despicable place of business. I was in town visiting, things came up, and I needed a place to stay last minute. This hotel was write in the middle of Belmont and only about 90 a night so I thought wow what a deal right? WRONG! I was angered enough that only one of the two heaters in the room worked, the windows did not shut completely, and that the place was just completely run down. If that was not bad enough after I came in for the night I pulled back my bedding to hop into bed to find pubic hairs and a small blood stain. THATS RIGHT PUBIC HAIRS AND A BLOOD STAIN. So what did I do next? I marched down to the front desk where I asked for clean sheets. They informed me that housekeeping was gone for the day and that they just rented their last room so there was nothing that they could do for me. Never in my experience of staying at inexpensive institutions have I seen a hotel/motel. I just sucked it up, and I went back upstairs and brushed the debris out of my bed. After trying to sleep for about an hour I realized that now neither heater in my room worked. At this point i went back down and asked what was wrong with the heat to be greeted with the response &quotThere is nothing I can do its broken!&quot After all this I just went back up and suffered through the night awaiting my chance to get out of there. At some point I finally fell asleep and was abruptly awakened by a lady slamming on my door and screaming &quotITS CHECK OUT TIME AND YOUR STILL GET THE HELL OUT&quot. I packed up as quickly as I could and headed down to the front desk where I demanded to speak to a manager. I was informed that the only time that a manager is present is around 8am in the morning. I am currently attempting to contact the manager in an attempt to receive a refund via the phone number on the one inch square piece of paper i was handed as a business card at the time of my complaints.

name:Allerton Hotel
location:Chicago,USA
date:Nov 16 2009		
content:Great location 	This is a great location, in terms of shopping and seeing the most attractive part of downtown Chicago. The hotel itself is relatively inexpensive for this part of town and for overall quality. There are a few aspects of the place that are a drawback, as has been noted in prior reviews. First, the place is hampered by its inadequate elevators. Even though it has five, you find yourself waiting a fair amount, including just getting to the lobby from the street level. Second, the rooms can be small. I had a corner room on the 11th floor, which measured roughly 9 x 11, leaving little room beyond that taken by the bed and desk. There was virtually no drawer space, and the closet and bathroom were also tight. For one person, it was acceptable, in a European/sailboat kind of way. The room itself was nicely done, with fairly good quality bedding and finishes. In talking with other guests, I got the impression that other rooms were somewhat larger, though not expansive.As for other aspects, breakfast was an anemic buffet priced at $15.00. The hotel has a large workout area on the top floor.Overall, I think the Allerton is a fairly good option, especially at the price.

name:Ambassador East Hotel

date:Nov 10 2009 	
content:Great Location but Rooms are Very Dated and Run Down.	This hotel is in a great location, nestled in the upscale Gold Coast neighborhood, very close to local restaurants, bars, walk to Lincoln Park/Beach or shopping on Michigan Ave. I love the location and was expecting an old historic hotel that is not in perfect shape. However, I must say that even so, I was sadly surprised by the rundown state of the rooms. We stayed in a parlor suite, and the space was nice, but the furnishings were dismal. The couch was rubbed thread bare in several places. The bathroom is completely out of date with chipping paint in the tub. The two TV's (one in bedroom and one in living room) were 20&quot with poor reception. It was very disappointing to see this grand and historic hotel in such a state of disrepair.

content:excellent convenient amenable staff	I have used and recomened Amber Inn for at least the past 5 years, maybe longer. My organization co-sponsers 2 events/year end of august, early december. People come from all over the country, even some from canada and france and have had no complaints from any that have stayed there. I always let people know that there is no room service(meals brought to you) and if that's what they want they may opt for more costly downtown hotels. Most have eaten at restaurant whose management has changed thru the years, but I have yet to recieve complaints. Ms. Smith and her staff have always been resourceful, courteous, professional. Extremely patient as I have added, canceled up to the last minute, and they have never been rude or like I'm bothering them from doing their jobs. Unfortunately, there are never enough rooms as our events occur when there are so many other ones going on in the city. People that we have had to place at other hotels have accused me of showing favoritism by assigning some to Amber Inn and they could not get rooms there as they wait too late to book...especially when the people who stay at Amber brag about how good they were treated and the courtesy of the employees. We are again staying at Amber Inn end of this month. Hats off to Ms. Smith who demands nothing less than complete customer satisfaction, and the staff that lives up to those expectations!	Best small Hotel on the SouthSide	Look if your looking for excellent service, cleanliness, location, value, and room then go to a 5 star!!! If you dont have five star money, then you dont [--] about staying at an Inn. Im a regular at the Amber Inn and Its the best hotel that you will find on the south side of chicago!!!!

content:Great Business Trip to Avenue Hotel Chicago	The Avenue Hotel is a great business hotel with an unbeatable location and great amenities. The rooms were top-notch and everything about my visit went smoothly. The hotel is a short walk to the Magnificent Mile and all the shops and restaurants you could want. If not for my business trip and more personal time was available it would have been ideal. I must make a point of making it back here for a more relaxing trip in the near future.My room was clean, comfortable and had a great view. The amenities were great and the bed was unbelieveable. I dont remember ever having such a good nights sleep in a hotel much less on a business trip. The staff at the Avenue hotel were wonderful. From the front desk staff to the bellmen, guest services and housekeeping, the entire crew went out of their way to assist with plans both inside and outside of the hotel, and the hotel bar and its wait staff are experts at serving business groups -- attentive but not overbearing.In general, my stay at the Avenue Hotel was exceptionally smooth and productive. Our business meetings went smoothly, the rooms themselves were comfortable and had all the up to date equipment for presentations. I would recommend this hotel to any business group, but also to any tourist looking for a hotel convenient to many popular downtown Chicago spots!

name:Almanar Hotel Apartment
location:Dubai,UAE
date:Oct 26 2009 
content:Good overall service 	Just came back after a week at this hotel. The Al Manar hotel apartments (part of ABC group) is located a 10 minute drive from Dubai international Airport which will cost around 40 dirhams by taxi which is £7.00. We had a very big room including a kitchen area that consists of frige freezer, washing machine, microwave, toaster, kettle and electric hob. You also get some basic cuttlery and the fridge has a mini bar (Non Alcoholic drinks only). It also has a secure safe, nice table and chairs, ironing board/ iron and the all important flat screen TV.The hotel is a ten minute taxi drive to the Al mamzar beach park costs around 14 dirhams £2.50 entry fee to the park is five dirhams £0.90p. There is a pool area, place to eat, male/female changing area and a lovely beach.The gold and spice souk/market are not far away if you like that kind of thing. I would recommend going to the Wild Wadi Water park great fun for adults and kids and you can get some great pictures of the Burj Al Arab. We went bed and breakfast. The breakfast is not the best i've had on holiday however its not the worst. The only other downside is there are no fantastic views from your room as there is a construction site next door however we hardly noticed it as we spent most of the day sight seeing. Noise you cannot notice as all windows are fully double glazed. The staff are quite friendly and always willing to help. There is a small pool on the rooftop with sun loungers a shower area and toilets for that all important tan!Location wise its ok, however if you decide to travel to the Jumeirah end it will cost by taxi around 60 dirhams £10 each way and more if you venture futher afield. There is now the partially completed dubai metro(un manned automatic train Like the DLR in London) which you you can get around town with running from Jebal Ali to Rashidya called the red line started 7 weeks ago. However from the hotel you need to get a taxi to Deira city centre station 10 mins away. Its very modern and very clean with the average single trip costing 4/5 dirhams less than £1.00. You can buy a silver card for 6 dirhams and top it up as you go. (A bit like an oyster card on the London underground but way cheaper ! The green line will be completed by mid 2010. The only other thing is that you must get into the right compartment as there is a women and children only carriage the others are mixed. Perfect if you want to go to the emirates mall. There are a good few places to eat nearby the hotel serving western and indian food. I quite enjoyed the iranian chicken sandwich made in fresh bread from accross the road. Drinks are very cheap too stock up as you will need it due to the heat ! I would recommend this hotel to anyone on an average budget.

name:Admiral Plaza
location:Dubai,UAE
date:Jul 11 2009
content:Not the Burj Al Arab but a safe centrally located hotel suitable for budget minded travellers	I am a single female traveler who stopped over in Dubai for three nights on my way to Rwanda. Being alone my first trip to Dubai, I required an economical hotel in a secure area with easy access to historical sights. I researched several hotels on Trip Advisor and settled on the Admiral Plaza. I had read a few reviews complaining about the establishment but there are always people who are hard to please. I have nothing but compliments for the staff and service. The front desk staff went out of their way to help me. The complimentary shuttle which I ordered for 7 00 a.m. was right on time to take me to the airport. The price, including a breakfast buffet, was very reasonable, around $270 Cad. total for my stay. The breakfast wasn't fancy but there was certainly a lot of variety in the hot and cold food available. The waiters continually cleared tables and replenished dishes. My room was clean and quiet.I enjoy exploring new areas on foot and found the Admiral Plaza a great location. The abras are nearby for those wishing to cross the creek and visit the Gold and Spice Souks. I would highly recommend the nearby Heritage House and adjacent school. On the Burj side itself, the Museum provides an interesting cool respite from the heat - 40 degrees in June.The bus terminal is nearby for those who want to visit Burj Al Arab or the Mall of the Emirates. I also took a Taxi from Burj Al Arab to the Palm and Atlantis.In brief I had a very enjoyable stopover in Dubai. I would certainly stay at The Admiral Plaza on a future visit.	

name:Al Bustan centre residence
location:Dubai,UAE
date:Jan 19 2007
content:Great value for money	I stayed one night at the Al Bustan Centre and Residence, while in transit in Dubai.Positives Price At around US$75 this hotel is an absolute bargain for Dubai, a city with traditionally very expensive hotels.Friendly and efficient staff While I only dealt with the staff at check-in and check-out, they were professional, courteous and efficient. My room key was waiting for me when I arrived. Check-in and check-out only took a few minutes.Room I booked a studio room (#3255) and was very pleasantly surprised. The room was large (around 450 sq feet or 43 sq meteres) which is a very decent size. The bathroom was also a decent size with good bath and shower, and basic toiletries. I did not use the kitchen facilities, but noted there were plenty of pots, pans, glasses, a large fridge and a microwave. Good curtains blocked out the intense morning sun and all light. Air conditioning was very good which is important in a city as hot as Dubai. Furniture and room amenities appeared modern and in good condition. Sound proofing between rooms was excellent.24 hour reception I arrived around midnight and was slightly worried (given the cheap price) that the hotel would be closed. There was no need to worry as there were plenty of staff available in the lobby and front desk.Negatives Traffic While not really the hotel's fault, the traffic from the hotel to the airport was horrendous. It took me around 80 minutes to reach the airport. I would have missed my flight, but luckily I had my watch accidentally set to a different time zone (one hour behind). I intended to leave the hotel at 10am but inadvertently left at 9am! However, the trip from the airport to the hotel via taxi at around midnight took 10 minutes.Location Unless you are looking for a transit hotel to spend one night, the location of this hotel has very little going for it. It is a long way from Dubai, and the traffic is so bad you will end up spending most of your time in taxis.Long walk with the bags The room corridors are extremely long and the walk from reception to the room (at least the room I had) is probably half a mile long! If you have a lot of luggage consider asking for a room near to an elevator.Overall I was surprised to read all the negative views of this hotel here on Trip Advisor. While the hotel is far from the best that Dubai can offer, it represents fantastic value for money. It's only big downfall is the location which is inconvenient to everywhere except the airport. I would definitely stay here if transiting Dubai again.

name:Al Bustan Rotana
location:Dubai,UAE
date:Oct 21 2009
content:Hotel excellent	We stayed at the Al Bustana 7 years ago and were very impressed so we stayed there again this month. It has if anything got better and in the meantime we have stayed at hotels across the world and the Al Bustan is up there with the best. One minor point it is close to airport so no problems getting to and from the airport which is very useful bearing in mind Dubai traffic jams but it does mean it takes time to get into town if you intend to spend a lot of time there. Hotel provides a taxi service charged at normal rates., nice vehicles good drivers.Service from start to finish was excellent . As for most hotels you have the opportunity of picking out an employee who had most impressed, this was an impossible task as everyone excelled , reception, porters, restaurant staff in all the bars/restaurants, pool staff, Club Rotana staff and most definitely the housekeeping staff ( our room was maintained spotlessly ). Room had everything you need .We had paid extra for a Club Rotana room which we feel is worthwhile , before you go down to dinner you can have drinks and a selection of snacks (hot, cold , cheese , desserts etc ). You also have access to computers , a dedicated employee in the Club to help you , coffee and copy of Daily Mail in the morning.Also worth bearing in mind that even with air conditioning rooms facing sun can get very hot so worth checking when you arrive.Buffet breakfast is served in Choices good selection . We also ate in the Blue Thai restaurant , the Rodeo grill ,Choices in evening and the lobby lounge all excellent with matching servicePool, jacuzzi etc well maintained . Life guard on duty, plenty of umbrellas,nice bar.All in all a relaxing and enjoyable week

date:Nov 19 2008
content:Dubai on a Budget	My husband and I spent a long time looking for a cheap place to stay in Dubai on a 3 night stop over from south east asia. The Al-Hijaz was the best deal we could find.We had arranged an early morning airport pick up via email. Although we couldn't find the person to pick us up initially, he was waiting outside. We arrived at the hotel at around 6 30am and had to wait until 11am to check in, despite no one else staying in the hotel. We eventually checked into our room, which was very nice, quite traditional and basic, especially when comparing it to other hotels in Dubai, but comfortable. The major down side to the room was the mosque tannoy system directly outside our bedroom window. This made for a loud alarm call at 5am every morning.The breakfast was terrible, with no choice. An omlete and bread with tea or coffee. Some staff were friendly others were very grumpy.Overall this is a good budget option for dubai, though with a better breakfast and no tannoy at the window this would make for an excellent option in Dubai.

content:The most disgusting place to stay! Terrible customer service and rooms are dirty and full of roaches.	We paid $75 dollars per person at this hotel, it was 4 of us. It was the only available hotel at that price. When we went to the room ut ws absolutely disgusting. It was dirty, no toilet paper, just one soap and liner for the toilet, we were lucky to get one set of towels for all of us. The heater wasnt working and it was patched up with black tape, so were the walls and batroom door, full of wholes. The room was tiny and smelled strange.The best was very uncomfortable and it was covered with only the sheets, It was cold! It was a very depressing view. We couldnt get our money back so we stayed. We left very early to eat and left my 18 year old brother sleeping in the room. They called my brother one hour before the time we were supposed to leave to remind him. We got lost and couldnt make it back where the hotel was on time and they had kicked out my brother from the hotel and asked him to pay for another day if he wanted to stay the extra hour that we were late. He paid them the extra hour and stayed inside because it was raining and there in no where no go around there, their lobby was wet since the roof is dripping. As soon as we got there they went inside the room and wanted to clean it and I told them to get out since we had paid the full amount for one day eventhough we were not staying. They are nasty peopl!I forgot to say they were roaches in the bathroom and they only pick up the visible trash from the floor and straighten the bed linens without changing them!!

content:Awful! noisy felt unsafe. Don't confuse with Americana 5 Inn 4244 N. Las Vegas Blvd	The red and blue doors and stairs agains the white building are about the only 'good' (as in cute in a kitsch kind of way) thing about this place. I think my partner, who booked it, must have read the review for the other Americana 5 here on Tripadvisor. As we drove up the road along the side of this motel, the first thing I noticed was that a room in the middle of the second storey was boarded up. Then I noticed that it was because there had been a fire. That did not bode well but I thought 'hey these things happen' and kept an open mind.The room did not smell - unlike other reviewers here. However, it was late November. I don't know what it would be like in the summer. The electrical sockets (outlets) were in holes in the wall that were too big for them (ie there was a dangerous looking gap).The toilet seat and lid were a nasty cheap soft plastic and was torn in several places.There was a microwave and fridge - however the microwave was on a television wall bracket - so the door could not be opened (not that I intended to use it)the fridge was incredibly noisy. So much so that I had trouble getting to sleep and then it woke me at 4am. It was louder than the road noise - and that was loud!The door had no additional lock and was quite flimsy. Anyone could have broken in quite easily. There was a gap around the door that let in daylight and draught.No breakfast (but I wouldn't have wanted it).Don't stay here. As someone else daid - I'd (almost) rather sleep in the car.Before we arrived, having booked one night via the web, we considered staying an extra night in Vegas. We didn't bother. No wifi.

content:I'm Glad it Stays in Vegas	We booked a room in this place because they allowed dogs. Having said that, our experience was something else. When we checked in the magnetic room keys weren't working so each time we left the room we had to wait for security to come around and let us in. We had to request additional towels and washcloths there was NO hot water (no kidding) and we didn't find out until we were in the shower. The wireless internet service was 8.95 a day and didn't work (another credit card charge that isn't refundable). And I forgot to mention the hookers who patrolled the parking lot outside our room on the ground floor. While many customers saw them as a bonus, their heels clicked all nite long and drove the dog crazy. We left after one night and now must fight between the booking service and hotel for a refund that we will never see.

But if you go in with an open mind and knowing what a 2 star hotel looks like or should look like then there will be no disapointments. The hotel has large rooms. The pool is pretty small but clean and you will have it to yourself most of the time. There's 2 security guards walking around the property 24 hours a day. There's a good size casino with 5 restaurant options including a daily breakfast, lunch and dinner buffet. The hotel is about a 10 minute drive to downtown and about a 15 minute drive to the strip. The room was clean everyday when we got back. My wife and I were impressed with the service and room for the price and we will definetely be staying here next time around. When my wife and I travel the only thing we use our room for is to sleep and store luggage the rest of the time we are out and exploring. If this sounds like you, this hotel will not disapoint you.

name:Bel Aire West

content:FRAUD at Bel Aire West	We pre-paid our bill through Hotels for a charge of $377.55, AND was incorrectly charged again for $136.25 to stay at the Bel Aire West Hotel, advertised as a 4-Star hotel, with gourmet meals and King-size beds. However, upon our arrival, the absolute opposite was true. We were given a room with a full size bed, hard as a rock, there was NO room service for the three days we were there, no fresh bed linens (there was still long, black hairs stuck in the unwashed comforter from the last guest), no fresh towels, no trash picked up. There was no coffeemaker, no coffee. In our room there was a fridge and microwave, however, no plates, no silverware only plastic ware. There were NO gourmet meals. They served velveeta cheese in the omelettes and the ham for the Thanksgiving dinner was as tough as leather. The heater did not work properly, it took serveral hours for the room to heat up. We were told that we could not get our money back, because we had pre-paid through Hotels And it is impossible to find another hotel on Thanksgiving weekend, so they knew we were forced to stay there. Upon going to the manager, Cliff Singleton, his response was to only laugh, and then argue with me. At first he tried to claim that we never stayed at his hotel. When I was finally able to reach him to describe our horrible experience there, Mr. Singleton continued to laugh, be beligerent and argue that he was not responsible for correcting the 4-Star rating for his hotel and that Hotels.com was responsible for changing that rating. It seemed he was used to screaming at customers the way he was screaming at me. Then on December 1, 2003, long after we had checked-out Thanksgiving weekend, Mr. Singleton charged us again, for $136.25, claiming we did not show up to his hotel. But we were there for three horrible days! I called my bank to let them know that I was now being double billed, when we had already pre-paid with Hotels. I can only fill out a complaint form. Meanwhile, Mr. Singleton is allowed to take $513.80 from my account which is not legally his! THIS PLACE IS A FRAUD AND A NIGHTMARE!!!!

content:solid as a rock	22 Jermyn has always been a favourite. You cannot beat the location a small private hotel in central London. I stayed here ten years ago with my husband en route to Athens. I returned to the same suite to find nothing had changed, not even the decor. (they have upgraded the television sets) While that familiarity is comforting when traveling alone, it could be said that 22 could do with a good spiff up paint job, new carpets, etc. The best part of 22, however, is the staff. They just cannot do enough to help you. I required a bit of assistance, and they were OUTSTANDING in every way. They will always be my default choice. You might get a fancier lobby or a trendier room, but you won't get better service. Try Veraswamy (Indian) for dinner around the corner, or go to Fortnum and Mason and choose a picnic to enjoy in the room.

content:good service and breakfast clean room though a little small	I was very pleased with my stay here and am horrified to read the other reviews. It doesnt sound like the same place at all. The date of my stay and the other reviews show that I got the benefit of the refurbishment that one of the reviews mentions. My room was clean (not sparkling, but ok) but a bit on the small side. However, it was ok for my needs. The hotel generally looked a little worn but not shabby. I suppose they must have spruced it up. The furniture in the room was a bit cheap and could do with some more updating, but this is a very minor point. Also, there was heating and it was very efficient. In fact I had to get them to turn it off, it was so hot. So that looks like its another problem fixed.I was very pleased with the service. The staff were very helpful and polite and even managed to get me a downstairs room when initially none were available. This was handy for me because my leg was in a cast at the time. Breakfast was quite good and when there was a small problem with an undercooked sausage they replaced it right away with no arguments. I'm sure there are problem in the best of places so the acid test as far as I am concerned is how the staff deal with any issues. I was very pleased.The internet access was a breeze to set up, worked straight away and was very fast. And it's free.From my experience I have to conclude that all the problems mentioned in the other reviews must have been fixed now. It was not a brilliant stay but I was happy and it is at the cheap end of the market. I am pleased with the level of service too, so if I get stranded in Ealing again and need to be in the office the next day I would stay there again.

content:Overpriced small prefabricated cell	I appreciate that the development is still at final fit out stage. The entrance down a long white corridor of plain white walls is not welcoming. The reception staff was friendly and helpful but there seemed a lack of professionalism in his search for a room key (credit card type). I proceeded to the room down a corridor lit by motion sensitive lights that didn't quite keep up with my leisurely pace. The key would not open the door despite trying the tip which the receptionist had told me - back to reception who relieved me of the credit card type key and gave me a good old fashioned metal key - back to the room only to find that while I could now open the door I could not put the lights on because you need the credit card key for that. So the round trip to reception again. The room is obviously pre fabricated and dropped into place during construction - it is small and furnished in modern style. The bedroom area was little bigger than then bed, the bathroom big enough for its purpose, just, and the lounge kitchen would charitably be referred to as cosy. I was glad I was alone in the apartment which was described as &quotExecutive One Bed Apartment&quot. To be fair what is there is reasonably comfortable overall and was clean. There did not appear to be any way to put the lights off except by removing the credit card key from the switch which caused a blue light to flash all night. In the morning while very stylish, I defy anyone to have a wet shave in the handbasin - a triumph of style over functionality. Normally I would expect to get dressed in the bedroom but it is so small I had to do so in the lounge.

content:great stay great location	I picked this hotel after reading other comments on this site. I thought it was a greatplace to stay. the staff was very friendly. the room ( 1 bedroom apartment) was clean and well furnished. the washing machine came in handy for a long stay. tough to use at first (it is a washer/dryer combination) nice kitchen. there is a tasco market just on the corner with great food. the underground ( liverpool street station) in literally accross the street. great for getting around London. be sure to get an unlimited Oyster card, only 28 pounds for 7 days, great value. the rooms look just like the photos. perfect type of lodging for long stay. living room, large bathroom, decent kitchen with dishwasher, sink, microwave, stove and over. there is no ocffee maker as we think of, there is a large pot that heats water so you use instant coffee. I brough along the new starbucks instant coffee since i had read a simular comment on another review. the water gets to boiling in like one minute. they sell coffee at the market as well as real cream. room was quiet. only down side is there is only one very small elevator so if you are are on an upper floor it can be a hike. with two persons and a large bag each is easier to take the elevator twice.

name:Airport Hotel

date:Nov 4 2009
content:Not as bad as I expected	If you compare this hotel to American standards, then yes I guess I would say this isn't the best place to stay for the money. But in comparison to India standards it wasn't all that bad. Maybe I just lucked out. The location was perfect in relation to the airport (domestic and international terminals). My bathroom was clean so was my bedding, the staff was responsive. I did order room service which wasn't to good, the menu was strictly vegetarian and over priced. I got much better quality and tasting food from the Shangra Lai hotel in Delhi for a little bit more money. Would I stay here again for a night...yes. I probably wouldn't for more than one night though.	

name:Ajanta Hotel
location:New Delhi,India
date:Nov 26 2009
content: overpriced- What a Rip Off	I stayed at Ajanta with my spouse and another relative earlier this month. The hotel is 15 mins by rickshaw to Connaught Place and is on a very busy and interesting street. We booked the family room and were quite astonished that the actual room was nothing like the pics on the hotel website.Those pictures are misleading. We were put in a ugly windowless room which is not up to international standards at all. The bathroom was not impressive also. The night when our relative arrived to join us, we were taken by the Ajanta staff to a hotel at the back of Ajanta and told that we needed to check in again. This was quite confusing and uncalled for. We had to be rude and grab our bags back and walk back to Ajanta''s front building.Like previous travellers who commented on this hotel, we were also offered tour packages. We were told that the price for just a driver from Delhi to Agra and Jaipur and back to Delhi would be £220 for 3 persons. Luckily we decided to visit the Incredible Travel Centre Office in Connaught Place before making any decisions and were shocked to be offered a package of £160 per person for a week trip to Delhi,Agra, Jaipur and Pushkar. This price included all hotels, taxes,driver, breakfast etc. We immediately accepted and checked out of Ajanta the next day never to return for the duration of our trip and I dont think ever to return again. Probably the best thing about this hotel is the restaurant which serves good foodyet it was very pricy compared to other hotel restaurants which had higher standards with cheaper but good food.I would not recommend this hotel to anyone . The staff whould also try to make the atmosphere at the hotel relaxed. We felt uncomfortable every time we came to he reception area because staff seemed so distant and unfriendly.

content:Close to perfect stay- and will be coming back	Was here for a week of business at the beginning of July and as I am here in Delhi again for another week I booked again at the Ambassador as I had such a pleasant stay my first go around. I will be coming back to Delhi several times over the coming months and I fully intend to stay here.The room themselves are excellent- clean and spacious with great work space (important since I spend a great deal of time working at my computer from my hotel room). Service in the hotel is great as they have a very polite, efficient and helpful staff. They can almost be too helpful at times and I've taken to leaving the &quotDo not disturb&quot light on to avoid the seemingly incessent knocks at my door asking if I need anything.The food is also excellent in all 3 restaurants as well as from room service. Only criticism I really have is for the lounge- InSomnia. It could be a great place to relax, if the music weren't so bad- apparently he feels that at the end of a business day a lone business traveller wants to listen to heart-jarring disco beats...Overall great hotel- terrible DJ.

name:Ashok Hotel
location:New Delhi,India
date:Nov 14 2009
content:Old glory that has disappeared for ever	I stayed at The Ashok for 4 nights at a business trip in the beginning of November 2009. What a disappointment. Old glory has gone and it will take a multimillion investment to ever get this back. The state of the hotel is miserable, the only thing that has been restored is the entrance lobby. The room was middle sized and looked rather Ok, but there is a big cleaning problem here. The floor was really dirty, no way to walk bare foot here. Free wireless internet was available and it worked well, but every 24 hours you had to return to the reception desk (very long walk!) to get a new voucher. There is a problem with staff in general and the front desk staff in particular. They are not interested at all to give any service to their guests. Their only interest seems to be to get tipped! As an example, I was informed two times wrongly about meeting places because the staff just didnt care to look it up properly, which resulted in two times a 10 minutes walk to the wrong place.The Ashok is a very big hotel in the diplomatic area of Delhi, so the surroundings are nice. This is the only positive thing I can say about this hotel. Next time I definitively will look for another place to stay in Delhi.

content:Stunning	My spouse and I live in New Delhi, but we stayed at this Aman to celebrate our anniversary. I agree with the previous reviewer - having lived in Delhi all my life, I can say with some confidence that this is by far the best hotel in the city.The highlight is the rooms. We had the basic one-bedroom suite, and it was absolutely gorgeous, and this I say even though I slightly preferred the rooms at Amanbagh. Judging from the other Amans' pictures, I'd say this is probably one of the nicest looking rooms in their repertoire. The plunge pool area with the daybed and large balcony is especially gorgeous, what with the light streaming in through the jharokas. The service was very good and the the massage rooms were well done. The head assistant manager was amazingly helpful - he helped my wife set up the surprise, showed her all the rooms she wanted to see so she could pick the one with the best view, and many other little things.On the downside, the lobby area as well as some other areas were unimpressive, the food was ho-hum, not at all tailored to the Indian palate, and the choice of vegetarian food was sparse. The hookah they made for us was terrible, so steer clear. They claim that they have a mughal architecture, and aside from one or two design features, they don't (but who's complaining?). The pool is nice, but not nearly as good as some other Amans.  Also I would suggest going after September (that's when they properly open) if you want to avail of any of the following services - hammam, steam and sauna, one of which we did but were not told aforehand of its unavailability.We were there on a Sunday, and the church nearby had a huge procession going on from like 4 in the morning. They sang very loud, and the songs were atrocious to boot, and really ruined my night... I couldn't sleep for more than 3 hours. So check up on this - I don't know if it's a Sunday morning thing or if it was some occasion.Despite it's shortcomings, hopefully all temporary, the room is so amazing that I can't justify taking off a star.
